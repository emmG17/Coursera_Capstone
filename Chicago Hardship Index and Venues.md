# Chicago Hardship Index and Venues

Chicago is a multicultural city and provides many opportunities to its inhabitants. However not all communities present in the city have the same distribution and opportunities are different for people living among different areas.
The Chicago goverment have deployed a **hardship index** which is multidimensional measure of community socioeconomic conditions, the higher the index the worse economical and social conditions are.
Using the information provided by Foursquare we want to asses which kind of venues are present in communities with different hardship indexes. If there are any differences, we can use this information to propose building specific tipes of venues to improve the communities conditions.
