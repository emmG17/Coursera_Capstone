# Chicago Hardship Index and Venues

Chicago is a multicultural city and provides many opportunities to its inhabitants. However not all communities present in the city have the same distribution and opportunities are different for people living among different areas.
The Chicago goverment have deployed a **hardship index** which is multidimensional measure of community socioeconomic conditions, the higher the index the worse economical and social conditions are.

Using the information provided by Foursquare we want to asses which kind of venues are present in communities with different hardship indexes. If there are any differences, we can use this information to propose building specific tipes of venues to improve the communities conditions.

Also we aim to verify if the venue consistency in a neighborhood will be a good predictor for the hardship index, this will be useful to quickly assess the conditions of different locations without censing the population directly.


# The Data

We are going to use the **Chicago Hardship Index** based on Census Data from 2008 to 2012, from this dataset we are going to use only two columns the Community Area Name and the Hardship Index.

Along this dataset we are going to use Foursquare database to check what venues are more popular in each of the Community Areas, we are going to use the Category column from this dataset. 

Lastly to plot our findings in the map we are going to use the shape files corresponding to the boundaries of the Community Areas provided by the Chicago City government.
