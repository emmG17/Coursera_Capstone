# The Data

We are going to use the **Chicago Hardship Index** based on Census Data from 2008 to 2012, from this dataset we are going to use only two columns the Community Area Name and the Hardship Index.

Along this dataset we are going to use Foursquare database to check what venues are more popular in each of the Community Areas, we are going to use the Category column from this dataset. 

Lastly to plot our findings in the map we are going to use the shape files corresponding to the boundaries of the Community Areas provided by the Chicago City government.
